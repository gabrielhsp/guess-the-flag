# Guess the Flag

Guess the Flag is a study app made using SwiftUI, being part of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), created by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws).

The idea of this second project is to study some concepts of a SwiftUI app, how we can create custom components such as gradients, buttons, alerts and stacks.
